## I don't know about you, but I don't see my friends or family nearly enough. Want to do 
something about it?

![](OBX-Love.jpg)

What are you doing the last week of July, 2021? The idea is to get just a little more friends 
and family into our lives.

Nags Head is the center of the action in the Outer Banks (OBX). So the plan is to rent a 
beach house there or at least near there. If there is a lot of interest we can rent a bigger 
house or perhaps even more than one house.

Well I would love for you to join me in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, a place I have 
visited and loved many a summer.

If you are unfamiliar with the amazing Outer Banks, you can find more information 
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Banks).

Here are a few of the options I have found that are currently available on AirBNB.

- [Option 1. Cheapest. JUST RENOVATED!](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/34533054?adults=14&check_in=2021-07-24&check_out=2021-07-31&source_impression_id=p3_1609794831_OPzQfmK5rWgJ4TV0&guests=1).

- [Option 2. Less Cheap. Sunrise Surprise](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/29557121?adults=14&check_in=2021-07-24&check_out=2021-07-31&source_impression_id=p3_1609794164_0MpG%2BXhSPdr9dELi&guests=1).

- [Option 3. Not Cheap. Dune it Wright](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38949923?adults=14&check_in=2021-07-24&check_out=2021-07-31&source_impression_id=p3_1609793722_RsG%2BEu3W21LblnwQ&guests=1).

Of course we are not limited to these choices. These are some options. Ultimately the choice 
probably is determined by the level of interest and preference requests that I receive.
